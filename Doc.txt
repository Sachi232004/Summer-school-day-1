2. WHY DID I USE SPECIFIC INPUT TYPES?

<input type="text">
	Used for: Free-form text input (e.g., names).
	Why: It allows the user to type in any characters. You use this for "Name" because it's generic text.

<input type="email">
	Used for: Email addresses.
	Why: Automatically validates that the input follows the email format (like example@mail.com). Also brings up the right keyboard on mobile.

<input type="tel">
	Used for: Phone numbers.
	Why: Allows number input and shows a numeric keypad on phones. Here, I added minlength and maxlength to ensure exactly 10 digits.

<textarea>
	Used for: Multi-line text input.
	Why: Perfect for messages, feedback, or any content that might need more than one line.

<input type="checkbox">
	Used for: Selecting multiple options.
	Why: Ideal for choices like preferred contact methods — a person may prefer email and phone.

<input type="radio">
	Used for: Selecting only one option from a group.
	Why: Great for “Inquiry Type” where the user can choose either General, Business, or Support.

<select>
	Used for: Dropdown selection.
	Why: Saves space and keeps the form clean. For "Occupation", a dropdown ensures only valid choices are selected.

<input type="range">
	Used for: Selecting a numeric value within a range using a slider.
	Why: Great for ratings (like portfolio rating here). It's more interactive than typing a number.


3. HOW DOES MY NAVIGATION STRUCTURE WORK?

I have added a <nav> tag to every page, positioned under the <header> tag. It has links to the other pages, like Home (portfolio.html), About (about.htm), and Contact (contact.html) pages.
It creates links to the other pages.
I have created an external link on the about page that opens in a new tab.
